# Music boat

  

### What is this bot?

- This bot is being made in response to google being a nice company and shutting down popular music bots (such as Groovy and Rythm. o7)
- Google will probably be going after more popular bots so i have decided to take this approach to allow people to setup their own bots with no need for me to run servers (because i assume google wont send a cease and desist to every person who runs this)
- Still haven't decided on a good name for it but it will be a open source bot with easy instructions and some sort of installer/program to setup and run the bot quickly and easily. Along with this, the bot will be highly customizable but will come with a default setup
- Should be able to run on Windows and Linux (I don't own a Mac so i'm sorry and the installer program wont work on linux)
- Due to its open source nature and a licence which i will put up eventually, other people will be free to maintain or edit this program so hopefully others can maintain this bot if i'm not around to do it

### Setup:
- will come soon.
- please dont use this bot in its current form
